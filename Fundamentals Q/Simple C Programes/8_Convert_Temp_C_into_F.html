    <h1> 8.	Convert Temperature Celsius into Fahrenheit </h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The two most often used temperature scales are as follows:
        <br>
        Fahrenheit <br>
        Celsius <br><br>

        Celsius vs. Fahrenheit <br><br>

        Celsius is the world’s most widely used temperature scale, commonly known as Centigrade and written as °C. <br> 
        Celsius is most widely used in scientific and medical applications because it is simpler to work with. <br> 
        Fahrenheit (written as °F) is still commonly used in many everyday applications in the United States.
        <br><br>
        Formula : F=(C×9/5)+32
        <!-- Formula : F=(C*5/9)+32 -->
    </p>


    <script>

        let Celsius = 50;
        let Fahrenheit = 0;

        // Using the above Formula : 
        Fahrenheit = (Celsius*(9/5)) + 32;
        document.write("The Value of the Temparature in Fahrenheit is : " + Fahrenheit);
