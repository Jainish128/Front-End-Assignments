   <p>
        JSON stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”, and it is a lightweight data interchange format. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.
   </p>
   <p>
        In simple terms, JSON provides a standardized way to represent data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is based on key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be a String, Number, Boolean, Array or Another JSON object.
